##Reflection

From this project, I learned how to fetch transcripts from YouTube videos using Python and store them in a database. I first used the YouTube API to get all video IDs from a playlist and then tried to get their transcripts with the YouTubeTranscriptApi.I faced several challenges along the way.One was connecting to the database. At first, I used a local PostgreSQL database, but I ran into connection errors and issues when deploying. I also tried using Heroku, but it required a payment method, so I couldn’t use it. Another problem was that YouTube sometimes blocks requests from my IP, which made fetching transcripts fail.The YouTube API version I was using was outdated so I had to switch to a different method to fetch transcripts correctly. This project helped me learn a lot about handling APIs, working with databases, and debugging errors. Next time, I plan to use an external PostgreSQL service like Supabase instead of a local database to avoid connection problems. I also want to explore ways to handle YouTube IP restrictions so my script can run more reliably. Overall, this project taught me both the technical steps and the importance of problem-solving when working with APIs and databases.
